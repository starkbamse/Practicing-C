# C Programming and Arduino Projects

Welcome to my repository where I've stored solutions to a range of exercises focused on C programming and Arduino projects. This repository showcases me and my teammates skills in both writing efficient C code and developing hands-on Arduino projects, reflecting my learnings and accomplishments during the coursework.

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized into two main sections - C Programming and Arduino Projects. Each section contains subfolders for the respective Work Packages (WP 1-6), where you can find the solutions to the exercises assigned during the course. You can also find bonus tasks and solutions to exam preparative exercises.

- **C Programming**: This section includes basic to advanced C programming tasks, demonstrating my understanding of variables, loops, functions, data structures, memory management, and more.
- **Arduino Projects**: Here, you'll find Arduino-based projects ranging from simple LED blink programs to more complex sensor integrations and IoT applications.

## Getting Started

To run the C programs, you will need:
- A C compiler, such as GCC, or an IDE like MS Visual Studio.
- Basic knowledge of terminal or command prompt commands for compiling and executing C programs.

For Arduino projects:
- Arduino IDE for compiling and uploading code to the Arduino board.
- An Arduino board and the necessary components for each project (as listed in the respective work package).

## Contributing

This repository serves as a portfolio of our work and is intended for educational and showcasing purposes. I welcome feedback and suggestions for improvement on our code. Feel free to fork the repository if you want to use these solutions as a starting point for your own projects.

## Code Comments and Documentation

All programs in this repository are extensively commented to help understand the logic and flow of the code. Please refer to the comments for a deeper insight into each program.

## Acknowledgements

I would like to thank my instructors and teaching assistants for their guidance throughout the course. Their expertise and feedback have been invaluable in completing these projects.
