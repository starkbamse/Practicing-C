Please explain the concepts of paging and addressing of memory.

Paging is when the operating system converts a logical address into a physical address on the RAM. It does this by looking at the logical address which is a binary number that represents both the page and the offset. The physical addresses are stored in pages. There are different pages and there are multiple entries in a page. Therefore, we use the logical address to determine the physical address (location on RAM) of a certain element.

Addressing is when the cpu uses these addresses to perform some kind of manipulation on the memory
